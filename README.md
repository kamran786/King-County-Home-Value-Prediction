# King-County-Home-Value-Prediction

The aim of this project is to develop a model to predict house prices before their sale. The data is drawn from house sales in King County House Data from the year 2014 to 2015. The dataset has 19 columns and 21,613 rows. Initially going through the code, I came across various logical errors and did the required changes. Like dropping independent variables showing high degree of collinearity from the dataset, removing lot of noise from the output and few other changes. I have also added proper explanation to what we are achieving with each part of the code or what each graph is telling or what significant information we can draw from it. As part of this assignment, I have tuned or fitted various classification and regression models on the dataset and analyzed how well they performed.

Logistic Regression Model
XGBoost Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
XGBoost Regressor
K-Neighbor Regressor
Linear Regression Model Apart from implementing classification and regression models on the dataset, I have also performed hyperparameter tuning. Hyperparameter tuning helped me to choose the best parameter for that algorithm and achieve better result for the dataset.
