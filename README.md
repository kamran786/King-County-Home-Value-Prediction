# King-County-Home-Value-Prediction
The aim of this project is to develop a model to predict house prices before their sale. The data is drawn from house sales in King County House Data from the year 2014 to 2015. The dataset has 19 columns and 21,613 rows. I have tuned or fitted various classification and regression models on the dataset and analyzed how well they performed.
